[[!tag type/pagespec]]

This plugin provides the `userdir()` [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]], which can be used
to match pages that are the users userpage or a [[ikiwiki/SubPage]] of it.

An example use is in combination with [[lockedit]] where setting
`locked_pages` to `!userdir()` would disable any user editing outside
of their own userpage.
